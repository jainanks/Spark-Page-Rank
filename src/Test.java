It is located in Finchley in north-west London. The current enrolment is about 200.\n\nThe school was set up in about 1950 to serve the needs of the growing chareidi community of Golders Green. Originally it occupied premises on Finchley Road, moving later to East End Road, Finchley. In 1990 it moved to its present location in Church End, Finchley. Between 1997 and 2000 it was the boys' site of the combined Pardes House & Beis Yaakov Primary School. Since 2000 it has been voluntary-aided school in its own right.\n\n";
